# This works. Don't read the code, it might be dangerous for your mental health
Seriously though, this was initially a project I only made for my dev team, but decided to put it in my portfolio and had to fix some bugs. I did it kind of hastily, and though it works, and in my opinion, it is good enough of a project, the code is a mix of new and legacy code, some parts and not used at all and I'm aware of that. However, I do not intend to do anything else with this project and therefore do not see the need to enhance the code. It works and this is all that matters to me
